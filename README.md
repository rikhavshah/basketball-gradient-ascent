# Basketball Gradient Ascent

The code repository for our CMSAC Reproducible Research Competition submission.

# IMPORTANT - For Reproducability
To be able to run the code, the following external python package dependencies exist:
* numpy
* tqdm
* pandas

The rest of the python packages (os, subprocess, etc) come built in with Ptyhon3.6. A necessary shell package that we
used to extract data from the .7z zip files into .json files was with [p7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). Note
that on a Mac system, this can be installed via HomeBrew with
```{bash}
brew install p7zip
```
